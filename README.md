# Classifying Images of Bears using Deep Learning

This was my first foray into deep learning. For this project in my graduate program, I collected over 1000 images of polar, panda, and black bears from the web and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on how to appropriately classify them by species. To validate the CNN was robust and generalizable, the images were augmented (i.e., translated, rotated, monochromatized, etc.) and the CNN was further trained and tested on this data. 

## Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) is provided that shows the procedures used to build the CNN. A HTML version of the notebook is also provided.

## Report

A PDF report of the findings from the project is also included.
